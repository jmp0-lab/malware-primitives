- use x64 (amd64) intrinsics list [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/x64-amd64-intrinsics-list?view=msvc-170] functions to encrypt/decrypt with AES (_mm_aesenc_si128, etc)

- inject in to the AV/EDR (self monitoring mechanisms?)

- implement a techniques in several ways to remain unpredictable (different ways of doing the same action and random choice)
